            "content": "# React dynamic list of goods\nYou have 3 button that should load [the goods](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_dynamic-list-of-goods/goods.json) and show them on the page using the `GoodsList`.\n\n1. `Load All goods` should load and show all the `goods`;\n1. `Load 5 first goods` should do the next:\n    - load all the goods;\n    - sort them by name;\n    - and show the first 5;\n1. `Load red goods` should load all the goods show only `red` ones;\n1. Server has only 1 endpoint returning all the goods, so you should do all the preparations in corresponding methods in `/api/goods`.\n1. `GoodsList` is almost finished, you just need to use corresponding colors for `li`s;\n\n## Instructions\n- Install Prettier Extention and use this [VSCode settings](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/tools/vscode/settings.json) to enable format on save.\n- Implement a solution following the [React task guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/react_task-guideline#react-tasks-guideline).\n- Use the [React TypeScript cheat sheet](https://mate-academy.github.io/fe-program/js/extra/react-typescript).\n- Open one more terminal and run tests with `npm test` to ensure your solution is correct.\n- Replace `<your_account>` with your Github username in the [DEMO LINK](https://marinatea.github.io/react_dynamic-list-of-goods/) and add it to the PR description.\n"

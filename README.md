Add link here: `[DEMO LINK](https://art1shok.github.io/react_dynamic-list-of-goods/)`

## Task
> Load [the goods](https://mate-academy.github.io/react_dynamic-list-of-goods/goods.json) and show them on the page

- Create a component `GoodsList` accepting an array of goods and rendering them inside `<ul>`
- Create a component `Good` accepting a good object and displaying its name using `good.color`
  (for example `style={{ color: 'red' }}`)
- Render 3 buttons loading the goods from server and showing them in the `GoodsList`:
    1. `Load goods` showing all the received `goods`
    1. `Load 5 first goods` showing 5 first `goods` after sorting them by name
    1. `Load red goods` containing only `red` goods
- There should be only one `GoodsList` showing different goods basing on the last clicked button
- There should be a new request to the server on each button click

## Workflow
- Fork the repository with task
- Clone forked repository
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:<user_name>/<task_repository>.git
    ```
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

## Development mode
